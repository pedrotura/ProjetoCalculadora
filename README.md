# ProjetoCalculadora
A functional calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations.

## Description
This project entails the development of a simple virtual calculator that can read user input, perform the corresponding operations and display the results up on the screen.

## What I've learned
Since this was my second attempt at creating a calculator, I mostly focused on coding without looking up any sources on the web or having someone guide me through the process. This resulted in me gaining loads of experience from having to create solutions that both work as intended and are easy to understand. Some examples of things I improved at include:

- designing layouts with grids instead of flexbox;
- borrowing some icons from Font Awesome;
- manipulating DOM elements with JavaScript;
- refactoring code so it looks cleaner;

## Tools used
The architecture is fairly simple, but it gets the job done:
